problem III (Strongly-component/Shortest-path/Minimum spanning tree) : 
Since the graph can be represented as an abstract data type and implemented mathematically
according to the graph theory. In this problem, 
a GUI representation of the graph has been used. 
In addition, calculations of the weighted edges to find shortest-path
(single source-single destination) and draw the minimum spanning tree explicitly 
by using colors (i.e. yellow for creating new nodes like 
users/groups and make it blue/green during selection and enter the edge weight) 
and Green for the spanning minimum tree. 
First, will be asked if you want a privacy graph (one-way path) or anonymity graph (two-way paths) 
After that, make a node just left click or double click on the screen, 
and enter a name for the node (user's name...etc.) and get few nodes by using a mouse.
Connect the nodes (i.e. draw a line in red color) by right click in the starting (first node)
and right click in the (second  node) connection by asking for a weight. 
Calculate the shortest-path : type the starting node in the left text box,
and the ending node in the one at the right text box and then press
the shortest path button (the path is highlight in Green color: minimum-spanning tree)
while the final total weight will be shown at the windows title.
Run the IDMsystem.java file to start using it.

A screenshot of inputs tests and results has been shown in my pgm2 report that will be sent to canvas.

I'm ready for any Demo, and further questions

Thanks!
